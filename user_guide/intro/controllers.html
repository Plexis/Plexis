	<h1>Controllers</h1>

	<p>
		Controllers are the heart of all your pages. A Controller is basically a class file that is named in a way that can be associated with a URI.
		Lets look at an example:
	</p>
	<code>
		www.yoursite.com/<var>page</var>
	</code>
	<p>In this example, Frostbite would search for a controller file named "Page.php".</p>
	
	
	<!-- Example Controller -->
	<h2>An Example Controller</h2>
	<p>
		Lets take a look at an example controller.
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;?php
class Page extends System\Core\Controller 
{
	public function index()
	{
		echo 'Hello World!';
	}
	
	public function test()
	{
		echo 'Successful Test!';
	}
	
	public function print($param1, $param2)
	{
		echo $param;
		echo $param2;
	}
}
?&gt;</pre>
	<p> 
		Here's an exercise for you. follow the instructions below:
		<ol>
			<li>First, Create this file: <dfn>application/controllers/Page.php</dfn>.</li>
			<li>Next, Place the contents of the example above into that newly created file.</li>
			<li>Now, type this URL in a browser of your choice: "yoursite.com/page"</li>
			<li>If you did everything correct, you should see "Hello World" on your screen.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- In depth view -->
	<h2>In-depth view of the Example Controller</h2>
	<p>
		As you might have noticed, the Page class extended a class named: <dfn>System\Core\Controller</dfn>. You may also be wondering why there is backslashes in the extended class name. First of all, the reason
		why we are extending the controller in the first place is because it ties the Page into the rest of the system, and allows your controller to inherit all all of the Core Controllers functions. 
		The Core Controller is known as the "Super Object" of the whole system. Second, The reason why the system controller name has backslashes in it is because the main controller is 
		<a href='http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rationale.php'>namespaced</a>. All classes, except for the page controllers, and models must be namespaced to prevent page and class naming clashes.
		<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; All class names must have the first letter capitalized! When namespacing, Each sub namespace must have its first letter Capitalized as well.</p>
		<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Since Page Controllers are NOT namespaced, the filename's are all lowercase!</p>
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- Functions -->
	<h2>Functions and Sub-Pages</h2>
	<p>
		In the example above, you may have notcied that what was in the "<dfn>index()</dfn>" function was displayed on the screen. By default, when only 1 paramater is given in the addressbar, the index() function
		is used. Now if we did a URL like this:
		<code>
			www.yoursite.com/<var>page</var>/<dfn>test</dfn>
		</code>
		
		Now you should see "Successful Test!" on your screen. What happened was, when Frostbite read that second param "<dfn>test</dfn>", it knew to load the "<dfn>test()</dfn>" function rather then the 
		"<var>index()</var>" function.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Passing paramaters to functions</h4>
	<p>
		Now we are going to learn how to pass paramaters to our functions / subpages. Enter this URl in your browser:
		<code>www.yoursite.com/<var>page</var>/<dfn>print</dfn>/<samp>welcome</samp>/<kbd>guest</kbd></code>
		You should see "welcome" and "guest" on your screen. Everything passed after the second segament in the url gets passed as 1 paramater to the function. The example function "<dfn>print()</dfn>", simpley just
		echo's out the first and second paramaters, which in this case is "welcome" and "guest".
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- Protecting Functions -->
	<h2>Protecting Functions</h2>
	<p>
		There maybe times where you wish to use functions in the controller, that you dont want accessed via the browser. To protect these functions, simply add an underscore as the first letter like below:
		<pre>
public function _noaccess() 
{
	// stuffs
}
		</pre>
		If the user where to type this function in his URL, the 404 page will show rather then the protected method.
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- Default Controller -->
	<h2>How to setup the Default Controller</h2>
	<p>
		In Frostbite, you can define a default controller to be loaded when a URI isn't present. You must edit the file "<dfn>application/config/routes.php</dfn>".
		<code>
			$routes['default_controller'] = "welcome";<br />
			$routes['default_action'] = "index";<br />
		</code>
		
		Those lines in the routes.php file will allow you to customize the default controller and functions to be loaded.
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- Constructors -->
	<h2>Controller Constructors</h2>
	<p>
		If you decide that your controller needs a Constructor, you need to make sure that you construct the main parent controller first! Otherwise, you will NOT
		inherit all the Core Controllers functions and instance. Highlighted below is the code you need to make sure and use in your custom Constructor.
		<pre>&lt;?php
class Page extends System\Core\Controller 
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		<var>parent::__construct();</var>
		// Your own constructor code
	}
}
?&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	
	
	<!-- Output -->
	<h2>Outputting data to the browser</h2>
	<p>
		In Frostbite, if there wasnt a way to load an html page, then the framework would be pointless. Be sure to check out <a href='views.html'>Views</a> and <a href='models.html'>Models</a>.
		to learn more about displaying html pages to the browser.
